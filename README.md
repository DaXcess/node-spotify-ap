# Node Spotify AP
A silly and pathetic attempt of rewriting Librespot-Java to TypeScript.

This project has not been tested in over a year, and I am not maintaining this, feel free to fork.

Also there is no documentation, though you can find a minimal example at `lib/example.ts`.

## Original Description

NodeJS wrapper for connecting with the Spotify Access Point. (basically librespot for NodeJS)
